# Image_Carousel_Templates

A collection of multiple image carousel design templates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These templates provide different styles and functionalities for displaying images interactively. This is a personal project intended for my own future use. Feel free to use these templates if they are helpful to you.

## Templates

Different styles of image carousels, all built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **Basic Image Carousel** - A carousel that has a simple design with next/previous buttons
- **Autoplay Carousel**  -  A carousel that automatically cycles through images
- **Thumbnails Navigation Carousel** - A carousel that uses small images as navigation instead of dots or circles
- **Infinite Loop Carousel** - A carousel that seamlessly loops

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ArtanaFio/Image_Carousel_Templates.git
```
2. Open any .html file in a browser to view the template.
3. Copy and integrate the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into your project.

## Customization

Feel free to modify:

1. Styles such as colors, borders, and navigation buttons.
2. The number of visible images at a time.
3. Animation speed and transition effects.
